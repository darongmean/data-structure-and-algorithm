;;; N-Queens Puzzle
;;; The puzzle is to arrange n queens on an n Ã— n chessboard so that no queen attacks any other.
;;; Each queen therefore has to be placed on the board in a different row, column, and diagonal from any other queen.

;;; Model the chessboard using a list of natural number (Nat) for each row.
;;; Ex: 3x3 chessboard looks like the following:
;;; 1 2 3
;;; 1 2 3
;;; 1 2 3
;;;
;;; The position of the queens could be modelled as a permutation of the numbers 1 to `n`.
;;; Then we can satisfy that each queen would be in a different row and column.
;;;
;;; Ex:
;;; [1 5 8 6 3 7 2 4] is one of the arrangement on 8x8 chessboard.
;;; The arrangement means the queen in the first row is in column 1, the queen in the second row is in column 5, and so on.
;;; The arrangement looks like the following on the board:
;;; *Q* 2   3   4   5   6   7   8
;;; 1   2   3   4   *Q* 6   7   8
;;; 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   *Q*
;;; 1   2   3   4   5   *Q* 7   8
;;; 1   2   *Q* 4   5   6   7   8
;;; 1   2   3   4   5   6   *Q* 8
;;; 1   *Q* 3   4   5   6   7   8
;;; 1   2   3   *Q* 5   6   7   8

;;; Using 3 bit vectors to represent the queen positions
;;; The 3 vectors determine which left diagonals, columns, and right diagonals cannot be used for the next queen.
;;;
;;; For ex: consider 5-queens problem which has this state: [11000 01010 00100].
;;; - 11000 means we cannot place a queen in either column 1 or column 2 because it would be under attack
;;; by an existing queen along a left-to-right diagonal.
;;; - 01010 means we cannot place a queen in either column 2 or column 4 because it would be under attack
;;; by an existing queen along those columns.
;;; - 00100 means we cannot place a queen in column 3 because it would be under attack by an existing queen
;;; along a right-to-left diagonal.
;;;
;;; The columns that can be used for the next row are calculated by taking the complement of the bitwise union
;;; of these sequences:
